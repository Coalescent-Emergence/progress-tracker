MVP progress tracker - Deployed to GitHub Pages

This repository automatically syncs and deploys the MVP tracker from the source repository to GitHub Pages.

> **Note:** The official roadmap and MVP status documents are now maintained in the [mvp-control-plane](../mvp-control-plane) repo; the files here are archived copies.

## How it Works

This repository uses GitHub Actions to:
1. Pull MVP tracker files from the source repository (Kerrigan) using sparse checkout
2. Generate a JSON file of issues from the GitHub API
3. Deploy them to GitHub Pages automatically

**Note**: Access to the private Kerrigan repository requires configuring a `KERRIGAN_ACCESS_TOKEN` secret. See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Label Conventions

The tracker categorizes issues based on labels:
- **Priority**: `p0` (critical), `p1` (high), `p2` (medium), `p3` (low)
- **Effort**: `effort:S` (small), `effort:M` (medium), `effort:L` (large)
- **Type**: `type:feature`, `type:infra`, etc.

Issues are automatically organized into phases based on their titles and labels.
